# The Parking Ticket System

The parking ticket system is a program that allows for customers to purchase a parking ticket. It is easy to do the setup for the owner of the parking lot, they just have to configure the currency and the price per minute for parking in the .env file.

## Requirement 1

The first customer wants a ticket machine that allows the customer to interact with it using the terminal. It should print out the possible duration values in the console, and allow the user to choose from them.

## Requirement 2

The second customer wants a ticket machine that allows the customer to interact with it by sending the wanted duration via an HTTP request over the internet and it can take any value that the customer wants.

## Requirement 3

The third customer wants a ticket machine that allows the customer to interact with it by entering the wanted duration into a text file and it can take any value that the customer wants. After the interaction, the program should of course clear out the content of the text file so it is ready for a new customer.
